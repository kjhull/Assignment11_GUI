If you have Github command line you can clone the repo by selecting the folder where you want to save the repo, opening the command line and typing 

```

```
Next, you need to make sure that all the correct packages are installed. Provided in the repo is a package list called
> requirements.txt

Open the command prompt and type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test out the GUI, go to the folder with your cloned repo and type the following in the command prompt:

A window should open where you can choose the COM port associated with your Bluetooth dongle.

From here, you can edit the code under the SPECIFIC commented out sections.

Please don't alter or delete any other code or you will get errors and spend more time debugging the GUI than trying to setup serial communication with your car.
